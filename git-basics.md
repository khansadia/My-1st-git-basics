# Git Basics
code previews can be done with the help of backticks, three of them before the "code" and three after. Backticks => ```
```
git add
```

Git add will tell git to start tracking the changes, and prepare it for commit.

```
git commit
```
Takes a snapshot of our changes and saves it as a version of our code. Makes it possible to go back to previous versions of the code if we have to .
```
git status
```
checks the status of the files that have been changed or not changed
```
git log
```
Gives you a list of recent commit history
